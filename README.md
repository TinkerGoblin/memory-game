# Udacity // Front End - _Project 2 Memory Game_

**Here, we'll be working on bringing interactivity, responsiveness, and replay value to a project template.**

**The memory game will involve matching pairs until all pairs are matched.**

Points of focus will be:

* Randomizing the cards when shuffled
* Creating a restart button to reset all events
* Keeping time of each game
  * a win stops the timer
* Keeping a star rating system
  * after 1 missed guess, a star is lost
  * the player can only go down to 1 star
* The number of moves made are tracked
* Congratulations appear when the player matches all cards
